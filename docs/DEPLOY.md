# Deploying ClearingHub to HashKey Chain

The hub has no owner, no admin keys and no upgrade path, so a deployment is final and safe to share.
It never holds funds.
Deploying costs only gas in HSK.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Foundry 1.5 or newer (`forge --version`).
- A deployer wallet with a little HSK.
- Testnet HSK comes from https://faucet.hsk.xyz/faucet.

Gas planning:

| | Mainnet (177) | Testnet (133) |
|---|---|---|
| Base fee | held at 500 gwei | about 1 gwei |
| Primary RPC | https://mainnet.hsk.xyz | https://testnet.hsk.xyz |
| Fallback RPCs | https://hashkey.drpc.org, https://177.rpc.thirdweb.com | https://133.rpc.thirdweb.com |
| Explorer | https://hsk.blockscout.com | https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net |
| `eth_getLogs` range | at most 5,001 blocks | at most 5,001 blocks |

At 500 gwei, deploying the hub (about 2.0M gas) costs about 1 HSK on mainnet; fund the deployer with a little more than that.
`docs/HASHKEY.md` has the measured chain facts behind these numbers.

Keep the deployer key out of shell history and out of this repo.
The simplest safe option is a Foundry keystore:

```bash
cast wallet import payminto-deployer --interactive
```

## 2. Deterministic address

`script/Deploy.s.sol` deploys with CREATE2 through the canonical deployer `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C` (present on 31337, 133 and 177) and the salt `keccak256("payminto.clearing.v1")`.
`foundry.toml` pins `bytecode_hash = "ipfs"` and `cbor_metadata = true`, so the same source and compiler give the same bytecode and therefore the same hub address on every chain.
A second run against a chain where the hub already exists reverts instead of deploying a duplicate.

## 3. Testnet first (chain 133)

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url hashkey_testnet --broadcast --account payminto-deployer
script/verify.sh 133
```

The address and the deployment block are written to `contracts/deployments/133.json`.
`script/verify.sh` verifies the source on Blockscout and falls back to Sourcify (`--verifier sourcify`) if Blockscout fails or is slow.
Commit the deployments file: the node, the dashboard and the Docker image read it.

## 4. Mainnet (chain 177) - required for a demo slot

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url hashkey --broadcast --account payminto-deployer
script/verify.sh 177
```

The address and block go to `contracts/deployments/177.json`, which the node and dashboard read automatically.

## 5. Point a Clearing Node at it

Use a fresh operator key that holds only a little HSK for settlement gas, never a deployer or treasury key.
Create `apps/node/.env` from the example; `pnpm --filter @payminto/node start` loads it, exactly like `dev`:

```bash
cp apps/node/.env.example apps/node/.env
# edit apps/node/.env:
#   CHAIN_ID=177
#   RPC_URL=https://mainnet.hsk.xyz
#   OPERATOR_KEY=<fresh key, a little HSK for gas>
#   ADMIN_TOKEN=<openssl rand -hex 32>
#   PUBLIC_URL=https://node.example.com
#   CORS_ORIGINS=https://dashboard.example.com
pnpm --filter @payminto/node start
```

Values exported in the shell take precedence over the file.
On 133 and 177 the node refuses to start if `OPERATOR_KEY` is one of the ten public anvil/hardhat keys, if `ADMIN_TOKEN` is `dev-admin-token` or shorter than 32 characters, or if it cannot tell where the hub was deployed.
That deploy block comes from `blockNumber` in `contracts/deployments/<CHAIN_ID>.json`, or from `DEPLOY_BLOCK` when you set `HUB_ADDRESS` yourself; the node scans for on-chain revocations from there.
`RPC_FALLBACK_URLS` defaults to the public fallbacks in the table above (set `none` to disable).

The token defaults to mainnet USDC.e `0x054ed45810DbBAb8B27668922D110669c9D88D0a`.
Agents need USDC.e in their own wallets and an allowance for the hub: either a one-time `approve(hub, cap)` (SDK `ensureAllowance`, the agent pays gas) or, with no HSK at all, an EIP-2612 permit from `AgentClient.signPermit` that the owner submits with the mandate and the node opens with `openMandateWithPermit`.
`openMandateWithPermit` is a new function, so the hub bytecode and therefore its CREATE2 address differ from builds before it; redeploy rather than reuse an older hub address.

To run the node and dashboard in Docker instead, see "Self-host with Docker" in the README.
For TLS, backups, upgrades and monitoring, see [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

## 6. A real mainnet smoke test for the submission

1. Fund two agent wallets with 1 USDC.e each and a little HSK.
2. Create one mandate per agent with a 1 USDC.e total cap from the dashboard.
3. Run the demo against mainnet with tiny prices (for example 0.001 USDC.e per call).
4. Settle once and record the `settleBatch` transaction link on https://hsk.blockscout.com for the submission.

Total cost is 2 USDC.e plus well under 1 HSK of gas (two `openMandate` calls and one `settleBatch` at the 500 gwei mainnet base fee).
